Once a blog grows past a handful of articles, keeping everything organized is harder than it looks.
renoun's directory primitives let you describe how content should be loaded, validated, and sorted in
one place.

## Start with clear directories

Group related content into directories that mirror the reading experience you want. Posts live in
`posts`, podcast notes might sit in `podcasts`, and long-form tutorials can have their own folder.
Each directory can define its own schema, sort order, and loader.

```ts
const tutorials = new Directory({
  path: 'tutorials',
  filter: '*.mdx',
  loader: {
    mdx: withSchema(
      {
        frontmatter: z.object({
          title: z.string(),
          date: z.coerce.date(),
          duration: z.string(),
        }),
      },
      (path) => import(`./tutorials/${path}.mdx`)
    ),
  },
})
```

Typed collections make it clear which metadata is available and prevent a pile of defensive checks in
your UI components.

## Add new content without wiring

When you drop a new file into the directory, renoun picks it up automatically. You can focus on the
writing while the directory handles validation and sorting.
