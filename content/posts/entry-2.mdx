Tutorial-style posts land better when the code is easy to scan. renoun ships MDX helpers that give
code fences a consistent toolbar, optional file names, and syntax highlighting without extra
configuration.

## Syntax highlighting out of the box

Register the languages and theme you need once in the `RootProvider`. Every fenced block picks up the
same presentation so your readers do not have to adjust to different styles post to post.

```tsx path="app/layout.tsx"
<RootProvider theme="nord" languages={['css', 'tsx', 'typescript']}>
  <html lang="en">
    <body>{children}</body>
  </html>
</RootProvider>
```

Add a `path` hint to your fence when you want to show readers where a snippet lives. renoun renders it
above the toolbar.

```tsx path="components/Hero.tsx"
export function Hero() {
  return (
    <section className="Hero">
      <h1>Build content-rich Next.js sites</h1>
      <p>renoun keeps your markdown organized and your UI expressive.</p>
    </section>
  )
}
```

## Show multiple files in one post

When you need to explain how several files work together, drop in as many fences as you want. renoun
keeps track of the metadata for each block so you can mix prose and code without losing your place.
