renoun treats content as the center of your application. Instead of reaching for an API client or a
bespoke loader, you work with typed collections that know how to read, validate, and sort the files in
your publication.

## Typed collections keep things organized

Every post in this example lives in the `posts` directory. The collection definition describes how
renoun should read those files, what data it should expect from them, and how they are ordered when
rendered.

```ts path="collections.ts"
import { Directory, withSchema } from 'renoun'
import { z } from 'zod'

export const posts = new Directory({
  path: 'posts',
  filter: '*.mdx',
  basePathname: null,
  loader: {
    mdx: withSchema(
      {
        frontmatter: z.object({
          title: z.string(),
          date: z.coerce.date(),
          summary: z.string().optional(),
          tags: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
        }),
      },
      (path) => import(`./posts/${path}.mdx`)
    ),
  },
})
```

## Keep React components close to the content

MDX keeps prose and React in the same file. You can import interactive components next to the copy
that introduces them, which keeps long-form tutorials readable and maintainable.

## Build new views from the same data

Because the collection tracks metadata, adding a tag page or an archive is mostly a matter of filtering
the existing entries. You do not have to wire up a new query layer every time you add a feature.
